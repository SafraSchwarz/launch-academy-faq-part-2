This is an example of me pseudocoding(by use of comments) through an exercise where I needed to write front end react code.
I wrote the comments as if I was explaining it to my future self or as if I was teaching someone.
I think this is a good example of how incrimental I can be while coding. I do it this way so I dont make mistakes and thus save time debugging.
